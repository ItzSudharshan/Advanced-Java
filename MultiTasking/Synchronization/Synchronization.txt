Synchronization is a mechanism that controls the access of multiple threads to shared resources, ensuring only one thread can access the resource at a time
-----------------------
Why Itâ€™s Useful
Synchronization prevents issues like race conditions, ensuring that threads work together smoothly without causing problems. It's essential for maintaining data integrity in multithreaded applications.
---------------------
public class SharedDocument {
    private String content = "";

    public synchronized void editContent(String newText) {
        content += newText;
    }

    public synchronized String readContent() {
        return content;
    }
}
In this example:

The editContent and readContent methods are synchronized.

If one thread (person) is editing the document, no other thread can edit or read until the first thread finishes.
