What is Maven ?
Maven: A project management and build tool for Java projects that automates the process of building, managing dependencies, and deploying Java code.
---------------------------
Why Use Maven?
Here are some reasons why Maven is great for your Java projects:

1. Managing Dependencies
In Java, we often need extra libraries to make our code work, just like you need all the ingredients for a recipe. Maven takes care of fetching these libraries for you. Instead of searching and downloading everything manually, you just tell Maven what you need in a simple file, and it brings it all together for you. It's like adding all your favorite dishes to a cart on Swiggy, and the app does all the fetching for you.

2. Automating Builds
Maven can also automate the build process. This means it helps compile your code, run tests, and package everything into one nice file (like a .jar or .war file). It's like placing an order on Swiggy and watching all the dishes get prepared and packed, ready for delivery—all without you lifting a finger.

3. Consistency
Every time you build your project with Maven, it works the same way. No surprises! This also means your teammates will have the exact same setup—so no more 'it works on my machine' issues. It keeps everyone on the same page, just like everyone getting the same dish when they order from the same restaurant.

Summary
Issue

Challenges Without Maven

Dependency Management
Finding, downloading, and managing libraries manually is slow and full of mistakes.

Build Consistency
Manual builds lead to inconsistencies, with each developer possibly using different methods.

Handling Dependencies in Eclipse
Adding and updating libraries manually in Eclipse requires a lot of repetitive effort.
