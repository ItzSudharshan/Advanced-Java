The File Class
The File class in the java.io package provides a way to represent file and directory paths, inspect file properties, and perform file management tasks.
-----------------------------
Commonly Used Methods of the File Class
Here are some frequently used methods in the File class:

1)exists() - Checks if a file or directory exists:
File file = new File("example.txt");
System.out.println("Exists: " + file.exists());

2)isFile() - Checks if the path represents a file:
System.out.println("Is File: " + file.isFile());

3)isDirectory() - Checks if the path represents a directory:
System.out.println("Is Directory: " + file.isDirectory());

4)getAbsolutePath() - Returns the absolute path of the file:
System.out.println("Absolute Path: " + file.getAbsolutePath());

5)getPath() - Returns the relative path:
System.out.println("Relative Path: " + file.getPath());
